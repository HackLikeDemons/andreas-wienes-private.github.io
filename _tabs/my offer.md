## Penetration Testing

In addition to the comprehensive security trainings and threat modeling workshops, I also provide professional **Penetration Testing** services to assess the robustness of your organization's security measures. A penetration test, often referred to as a "pen test," involves conducting simulated attacks on your systems to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by real hackers. With my expertise in IT security and hands-on experience in conducting penetration tests, I can help you identify weaknesses in your infrastructure, applications, and networks before they are exploited by malicious actors. By uncovering vulnerabilities and providing actionable recommendations to address them, my penetration testing services will significantly enhance your organization's resilience against cyber threats. 

[Contact me](https://andreas-wienes.me/about-me/#get-in-contact) to discuss your specific requirements and schedule a thorough and confidential penetration testing engagement to ensure the utmost protection for your valuable assets.


## Threat Modeling
Hackers have a special perspective on your IT infrastructure. That's why I offer a specialized workshop on **Threat Modeling**. By adopting the viewpoint of a hacker, I will guide you through the process of identifying potential risks in your company's IT infrastructure. Together, we will develop strategies to mitigate these risks, enhancing your organization's overall security posture.
