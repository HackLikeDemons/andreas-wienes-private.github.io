On March 9-10, 2023, YesWeHack collaborated with OTTO, Germany's leading e-commerce retailer, to host a Live Bug Bounty during the Nullcon Berlin conference, which is highly regarded in the European offensive security community. 

The event brought together a group of talented bug bounty hunters to identify potential vulnerabilities on OTTO's exclusive perimeter, culminating in an intense 30-hour hacking session. Dozens of participants took part in this unique opportunity to showcase their skills and compete for rewards while helping to improve OTTO's security measures.
