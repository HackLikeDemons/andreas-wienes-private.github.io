I think I was 8 years old, when my older brother and me where sitting in front of a 2.5MHz computer, the [Robotron A 5120](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_5120).

We spent the last hours typing characters and strange symbols from a paper magazine into this weird machine and had absolutly no glue what all that should mean. After some time and fixing a lot of typos, we somehow managed to transfer all those text from written paper into this miraclous machine. And then, I don't remember how, we started the executation of this code and in magically way a computer game (somekind of a space invaders clone) appeared on the black screen with green characters.

That was a magical moment for me, that changed my entire life. From this day on I felt in love with computers and so I spent a lot of time figuring out how they work, how to let them make things I wanted (mainly with Basic and C++), how to make them faster and. Many computers followed after this first expierence. Atari, Amiga, my first Intel 80386 and so.

What a crazy time we had back in the 90's...

I sticked with computers and programming, worked in IT in different roles and always wanted to learn more. Wanted to know how things work, wanted to find new creative ways to use them, always tried to improve things.

That's why I call myself a hacker.

It's not because I'm an expert level software developer (no I'm not) or because I not all details about Unix operating systems or anything like that. Nope, it's the mindset
