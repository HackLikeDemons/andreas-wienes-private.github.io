In November 2021 I was part of a small team ('Tychologen') that took part in the Cyber Security Days 2021 thankfully organized by the Ostschweizer Fachhochschule.

This is a short write-up for one of the web security challenges called "Muffin Shop", which was rated with medium difficulty.

I will publish two differnet solutions here. At first my own and then a shorter and smarter method by Lexiea, who also took part in the event.


## Introduction

![muffin](/assets/img/muffin.png)

> I'll take you to the muffin shop (d端d端 d端d端) I'll let you inject your little ..... payload... i guess. Anyway. Start the container and have a go at this little challenge. 

>Goal:
> Retrieve the flag from the template folder in a file creatively called 'flag.html'. 
Good luck!

## My Solution
This is what we see when we visit the web application for the first time:

![muffin-welcome](/assets/img/muffin-welcome.png)

Let's have a look into the source code of that page.

![muffin-source](/assets/img/muffin-source.png)

But there is nothing of interest in here.

So I started gobuster and discovered other endpoints.

![muffin-gobuster](/assets/img/muffin-gobuster.png)

But 'login' is the only functionality that is implemented in this version of the muffin shop.

Thankfully the CTF organzisers provided the source code of the application, so I could save a lot of time and jump directly into analyzing it.

From the source code we know that only three functions are actually working:

**login**

![muffin-source-login](/assets/img/muffin-source-login.png)

But the login function doesn't do anything, but writing the login attempts into a log file. So it's not possible to log into a user's account and attacks like SQL injection won't work here.

**logs**

![muffin-source-logs](/assets/img/muffin-source-logs.png)

This method will render a template called 'logs.html'.

Let's have a look on it:

![muffin-logs](/assets/img/muffin-logs.png)

As assumed our login attempts are logged and we are able to see all of them here. 

**rotate_logs**

![muffin-source-rotate-logs](/assets/img/muffin-source-rotate-logs.png)

We can use this methode to clean up the log file.

_It seems like this challenge is litteraly screaming for some kind of log poisoning._

From the source code we know that the app is using the Flask library. After a short visit of one my favorite websites [book.hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#jinja2-python) I tried a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) and entered {{7 * 7}} as the username.

![muffin-ssti-input](/assets/img/muffin-ssti-input.png)

And as assumed my input is evaluated by the backend, as we can see the number 49 in the log-file.

_So what's next?_

[book.hacktricks.xzy](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#jinja2-python) also contains some examples on how to exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
